# DEPRECATED
I will no longer be working on this repository as I've moved to neovim which can be found in my dotfiles:https://github.com/Mvzundert/dotfiles

# oh-my-vim
I'm trying to make sure I can get my entire vim setup up and running as fast as possible.
In the end this might up being something a bit more modular in approach.

# Available plugins
I'm still unsure how to keep this updated. For an overview of the plugins I used so far, check the
bundle folder.
